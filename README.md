[Me viveksb007](https://github.com/viveksb007) and [Devanshu Tak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devanshu-tak-012a22b0) made this awesome DOS game.
Works in TurboC++ (one with blue screen that you used to code in 11th and 12th if you had CS)
<br>
For windows XP turboC++ can be used directly 
<br>
For later windows you need emulated version [link](http://www.mediafire.com/?lgktllnjiqz3bw1)
<br>
For Linux you need DOS Box (Google it)
